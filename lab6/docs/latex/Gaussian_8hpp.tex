\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Defines the \doxylink{classGaussian}{Gaussian} class for representing and manipulating \doxylink{classGaussian}{Gaussian} distributions. 

This file contains the implementation of the \doxylink{classGaussian}{Gaussian} class, which represents a multivariate \doxylink{classGaussian}{Gaussian} (normal) distribution. The class provides various operations such as marginalization, conditioning, and transformation of \doxylink{classGaussian}{Gaussian} distributions. It also includes methods for computing log-\/likelihoods, gradients, and Hessians, as well as utilities for working with confidence regions.

The \doxylink{classGaussian}{Gaussian} class is templated on the scalar type, allowing for flexibility in the numeric precision used for calculations and to enable autodiff support.
